# PROJECT
1. Cleans and normalizes historical wind data.

2. Converts wind speeds from knots → m/s.

3. Computes theoretical wind power for a turbine with a 50m rotor.

4. Resamples daily, monthly, and yearly averages.

5. Plots daily, monthly, and yearly trends.

6. Performs a simple linear trend analysis to see if wind power is increasing/decreasing over decades.

7. Provides summary statistics for wind speed and power.
